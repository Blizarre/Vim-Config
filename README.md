Vim-Config
==========

My configuration files follows me anywhere !

This config file is mainly used under windows at work, which explain why the vimrc begin with a \_

The *vimfiles* directory contains all the tweaks I made to the vanilla vim :

 - French spelling has been added
 - The markdown syntax file has been tweaked : I added a very simple TODO-list syntax highlighting.
 - The MRU plugin : Most Recently used files, with automatic completion. Very useful.
